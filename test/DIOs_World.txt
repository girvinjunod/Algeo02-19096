[Senator Wilson Phillips's corpse is seen inside the burning truck.]

[DIO is seen standing in front of it, then looking away.]

[But he then hears Kakyoin and Joseph using their stands to climb up the building they crashed in front of.]

DIO: Hm.

[Joseph notices Kakyoin looking down at DIO.]

Joseph: What are you doing, Kakyoin!?

Kakyoin: I've got it.

[Kakyoin takes off his glasses.]

Kakyoin: I've figured out a way to reveal what DIO's Stand truly is.

Joseph: What?!

[The camera cuts to Kakyoin and Joseph using their stands as web slingers. A dim flash is seen in the distance.]

[The camera then shows DIO watching them from afar.]

[Katakana: Rumble]

Narrator: Whenever Noriaki Kakyoin sees his Hierophant Green, this is what he remembers.

[A flashback begins. A Message to My Friends by Yugo Kanno quietly plays.]

Teacher: Your little Noriaki doesn't try at all to make friends.

Teacher: It's not that the other kids don't like him, he just doesn't open up to anyone.

Teacher: As his teacher, I'm very concerned.

Kakyoin's Mother: I'm his mother, yet I still don't know why he's like that.

Kakyoin [his mind]: Ever since I was a child, I thought...

Kakyoin [his mind]:...that living in a city means meeting a lot of people.

Kakyoin [his mind]: But even in an entire lifetime...how many people meet others they can truly understand, and who understands them?

Kakyoin [his mind]: My classmates' address books are filled with their friends' names.

Kakyoin [his mind]: There must be about fifty friends in each...maybe even a hundred.

Kakyoin [his mind]: My mother has my father, and my father has my mother. (But I'm different...)

Kakyoin [his mind]: I'm sure rock stars and people on TV have tens of thousands of friends. (But I'm different...)

Kakyoin [his mind]: I probably won't ever have someone who sees me for who I am.

Kakyoin [his mind]: Because I don't have a single friend who can see my Hierophant Green.

Kakyoin [his mind]: It's impossible for those who can't see him to understand me.

Kakyoin [his mind]:...until I met Mr. Joestar, Jotaro, Polnareff, and Avdol.

Kakyoin [his mind]: I felt that way all the time.

Kakyoin [his mind]: I wonder why I get goosebumps when I think about Avdol and Iggy...

Kakyoin [his mind]: Perhaps because they were the first friends I shared a common goal with.

Kakyoin [his mind]: This journey to defeat DIO...even though it lasted only a few weeks...they became friends I truly connect with.

[The flashback ends.]

[Kakyoin pulls himself up next to a clock tower.]

Narrator: Noriaki Kakyoin looks at Hierophant Green and thinks:

Kakyoin (to himself): I'll make him invisible to everyone, just like he used to be.

Kakyoin [his mind]: Yes, to reveal DIO's true identity and defeat him...

Kakyoin [his mind]: I'll make his presence completely disappear!

[The second series intro is cued. JoJo Sono Chi no Kioku ~end of THE WORLD~ by TOMMY, Coda, and JIN plays.]

[The camera cuts to Jotaro and Polnareff riding the motorcycle they stole.]

''Episode 46: DIO's World Part 2''

''DIOの世界 その2''

Polnareff: Hey, Jotaro!

[Jotaro pulls up next to the wreck of the truck Joseph and Kakyoin were riding in.]

Polnareff: That car got totaled!

Jotaro: Up there.

[They both look up to where Kakyoin and Joseph escaped up to.]

Jotaro: Gramps and DIO are on the rooftops.

[The camera cuts to DIO leaping around, rooftop by rooftop before stopping.]

DIO: Only Kakyoin and Joseph are before me.

DIO: I see...They split up so they could attack from both sides.

DIO: So Jotaro and Polnareff must intend to attack me from behind...

DIO: Hm...How useless.

[While hovering down, he touches an invisible green string, in which it triggers an Emerald Splash Barrage.]

DIO: !?

[He hastily deflects the projectiles and jumps out of range...]

DIO: This is...!?

[...only to trip on another string that unleashes another Emerald Splash Barrage.]

DIO: Kakyoin's Hierophant!

[He deflects the projectiles and jumps off, only to trip in two more strings, deflecting the emeralds again and again]

[He touches an invisible string yet again and deflects]

DIO: Hmph!

[His leg makes contact with another invisible string]

DIO: Hierophant's barrier!

[He trips in another invisible string and deflects the projectiles with a kick, sending them flying towards a billboard (in the manga, it was in a bell tower).]

[DIO notices a hole in his crimson cape.]

DIO: Tch...

DIO:...hm?

[He notices a now visible string his leg almost made contact with.]

[The camera reveals many more strings.]

DIO: This is...

Kakyoin: That's right!

[The camera reveals Kakyoin atop a tower meters away from him, as Noble Pope by Yugo Kanno plays.]

Kakyoin: Hieropant's barrier, which activates when touched, [He points at DIO.] completely surrounds you for 20 meters in every direction!

[The camera zooms in his face]

Kakyoin: Now I can sense both your movements and The World's!

[DIO goes back to a standing position.]

DIO [while smirking]: Huh.

[Joseph is watching the interaction from afar, hidden on top of a nearby roof.]

[The billboard that DIO hit with the reflected Emerald Splash projectiles suddenly collapses.]

Kakyoin: Eat this, DIO!

Kakyoin: 20-meter radius Emerald Splash!

[Several barrages of Emerald Splash projectiles suddenly shoot from everywhere, as the camera circles around DIO]

[Everything slows down to reflect on the two's thoughts.]

DIO: You fool! You shall soon know...

DIO:...that The World's true power is, indeed, the power to reign over this world!

Kakyoin [his mind]: Bring out your Stand, DIO!

[Another Emerald Splash barrage is seen in front of the camera, but then it cuts to DIO, and the music abruptly stops]

DIO: The World!

[The World instantaneously appears.]

[Katakana: Doom]

[Just as the projectiles hit DIO and shatter, Kakyoin is suddenly flung back by a bass-boosted sound, a hole in his chest bleeding out.]

Joseph: !?

Joseph: Kakyoin!?

[The camera zooms to his face]

Joseph: He was suddenly blown away! Impossible!

[He hits a water tower, denting it and causing water to run out.]

Joseph: KAKYOIN!!

[He has a hole in his chest from the attack, spilling blood at an alarming rate. He also has blood coming out of his mouth and forehead...]

Kakyoin [his mind]: Wh-What... just happened...?

[The camera briefly shows it.]

Kakyoin [his mind]: Did he beat me?

[His injury paralyzed him completely.]

Kakyoin [his mind]: It's no use. I think my injuries are fatal. I can't speak...I can't even lift a finger...

[Kakyoin weakly looks at his Hierophant barrier cords falling in unison, all cut apart.]

Kakyoin [his mind]: It's 5:15...

Kakyoin [his mind]: That means it's around midnight in Japan...

Kakyoin [his mind]: I wonder what my parents are doing...

Kakyoin [his mind]: Maybe they're already asleep...

Kakyoin [his mind]: ...I'm sorry for making you worry so much...

[The camera shows more of the cords falling down and dissolving.]

Narrator: Kakyoin Noriaki's final thoughts were not of his parents in Japan.

Narrator: Though he cared deeply for his parents, when his mind drifted to the final question that puzzled him, thoughts of his parents drifted away.

Kakyoin [his mind]: I can sense every movement of those who touch Hierophant Green's barrier...

Kakyoin [his mind]: But DIO ripped apart the entire barrier at once...

Kakyoin [his mind]: Why wasn't it done strand by strand...?

Kakyoin [his mind]: It was completely simultaneous, without even a microsecond of time between them...

[Joseph is shown screaming Kakyoin's name.]

Kakyoin [his mind]: The entire barrier, over a 20-meter radius, was ripped apart all at once...?

Kakyoin [his mind]: How...? Without even the slightest delay...

Kakyoin [his mind]: How... all at once...?

Kakyoin [his mind]: How...?

[Soul particles are seen.]

Joseph: KAKYOIN!

Joseph: I-I can't let this continue!

[He attempts to summon his stand.]

Joseph: Hermit!-

[He is interrupted by DIO, whose cape is now missing.]

DIO: Joseph...You're next.

[He pulls back his shirt, revealing the scar that his head left when getting attached to Jonathan's Body.]

DIO: Don't you think taking the blood of a Joestar...would be just the thing to make Jonathan's body completely mine?

Joseph: DIOOOOOOOOOO!!

[The camera cuts to a dying Kakyoin, as A Message to My Friends by Yugo Kanno quietly plays.]

Kakyoin [his mind]: How could he hit them all with no time passing between them?

Kakyoin [his mind]: Time passing...

Kakyoin [his mind]: Time...

[He starts to piece it all together.]

Kakyoin [his mind]: Time...

Kakyoin [his mind]: The time!

[He finally understands The World's true power...]

Kakyoin [his mind]: I...I understand now...

Kakyoin [his mind]: H-How could this be...?

Kakyoin [his mind]: There's no other explanation...I-I have to tell them about this!

Kakyoin [his mind]: This terrifying truth...

Kakyoin [his mind]: Somehow...

Kakyoin [his mind]: I have to tell Mr. Joestar....at this rate, everyone...will be defeated...!

[Back to Joseph and DIO.]

Joseph: How dare you do that to Kakyoin!

Joseph: I'll take that body back, for my Grandma Erina!

DIO: Erina? Ah, that country girl.

[He lets go of his shirt.]

DIO: How foolish.

[He points at Joseph.]

DIO: I shall drink your blood and kill you!

[The camera cuts back to Kakyoin, who is determined to summon Hierophant Green one last time to leave a hint for Joseph...]

[Hierophant Green slowly powers up for one last Emerald Splash...]

[...and it fails, as Kakyoin coughs up blood and chokes.]

[Kakyoin tries again one more time...]

DIO: Joseph Joestar!

[DIO flies towards Joseph, ready for a killing blow]

DIO: DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!

[And then, Hierophant Green finally fires back at the Clock Tower, destroying its clock.]

[Joseph and DIO briefly stop.]

Kakyoin [As Hierophant Green fades away]: My final Emerald...Splash...

[Joseph stares in shock, as DIO looks at the tower, disappointed.]

DIO: What...he didn't even aim in the right direction.

DIO: I suppose he wanted to use up the last of his strength to go out with a bang.

DIO: Hmph.

[The camera cuts to Joseph]

Joseph [his mind]: Impossible...Kakyoin wouldn't do something pointless at a time like this.

Joseph [his mind]: So why in that direction?

Joseph [his mind]: What does it mean...?

Joseph [his mind]: Is he trying to tell me something...?

Kakyoin [his mind]: it's a...message...

Kakyoin [his mind]: it's the best i could do...

[The color slowly bleeds out of the scene...so does Kakyoin's life...]

Kakyoin [his mind]: mr. joestar...

Kakyoin [his mind]: please understand...

Kakyoin [his mind]: p-please....figure it out...

[The color bleeds out into a blue hue.]

[Kakyoin goes limp...and finally expires...]

Joseph: k-kakyo...in.....

[He tries to hold back his tears, mourning his friend's untimely death.]

[The camera shows his body.]

[A graph appears on the left side of the screen:]

''Kakyoin Noriaki''

''-has died-''

Narrator: Kakyoin Noriaki...has died.

[The camera slowly shows a mourning Joseph.]

[Then he immediately summons his stand and ties DIO up.]

[Awakening Darkness of The World by Yugo Kanno begins to play.]

Joseph: HERMIT PURPLE!

Joseph: The energy of the sun, HAMON!

DIO: Senile old fool! Your stand is too weak!

[He suddenly breaks free and flies away.]

[Joseph dives down as DIO begins chasing him]

[He uses his stand as some sort of web-slinger through the rooftops of many buildings]

Joseph [his mind]: Kakyoin...why did you shoot the clock tower?

Joseph [his mind]: What were you trying to tell me by shooting it...?

Joseph [his mind]: It must have been important!

[Meanwhile, Jotaro and Polnareff spot Joseph being chased, to their shock.]

Polnareff: It's Mr. Joestar!

Polnareff: DIO is chasing him!

Polnareff: But where's Kakyoin...?

[The camera zooms into Jotaro's face, and then it cuts back to the rooftop chase.]

Joseph [his mind]: Impossible, Kakyoin...

Joseph [his mind]: Were you able to solve the mystery of DIO's stand while all of that was going on...?

[Flashback to moments ago...]

Joseph [his mind]: He destroyed the clock with Emerald Splash...

[A clock is heard tickling, but it progressively slows down as Joseph deciphers the secret of DIO's stand.]

Joseph [his mind]:...he destroyed the clock's hands...

Joseph [his mind]:...he...stopped the clock...?

[He is shocked by this.]

Joseph: I-Impossible! Could it be...

Joseph: That the true power of Dio's The World...

Joseph:...IS THE POWER TO STOP TIME!?

[DIO smirks.]

[A flashback begins in DIO's perspective of things.]

Kakyoin: Eat this, DIO!

Kakyoin: 20-meter radius Emerald Splash!

[Several barrages of Emerald Splash projectiles suddenly shoot from everywhere, as the camera circles around DIO]

[The main part of Awakening Darkness of The World plays, and it immediately cuts to DIO summoning his stand.]

DIO: The World!

[The World appears.]

[Katakana: Doom]

[A bright flash briefly turns everything into negative colors, then into black and white, as a loud bass-boosted sound is heard combined with a tickling clock that quickly slows down.]

[The emeralds, Kakyoin, Joseph, and the billboard are shown frozen in place.]

[The World lowers his arm and stands next to his master, who brushes some projectiles off by putting his cape aside.]

[He and The World float towards Kakyoin, cutting down the Emerald Barrier cords and pushing aside rubble together.]

[They approach him, and the camera shows DIO's face, with a devilish smirk.]

DIO: This is...The World.

DIO: But since time has stopped for you, you can neither see nor feel him.

[DIO addresses his stand as ''he'' as a sign of respect. If you looked closely, The World can be seen slightly hovering up.]

[The World curls up his right hand into a fist.]

DIO: Hm...

DIO: DIE, KAKYOIN!

[The World pierces Kakoyin's chest. However, he maintains a blank expression and stays perfectly still.]

DIO: You don't even realize that you've been killed.

DIO: There's no way for you to know what happened.

[He looks over at Joseph, and smirks, putting his leg on Kakyoin's chest to propel him into the water tower once time resumes its course.]

[The flashback ends.]

Joseph: Understood, Kakyoin...

Joseph: You died to send me that message...

[Joseph is shown swinging through a building, and then everything comes to a halt, as a spectral image of Kakyoin is shown.]

Joseph:...and i've got it!

[Manga Chapter 254 ends.]

[Stand Eyecatch:]

STAND NAME: Hermit Purple

STAND MASTER: Joseph Joestar

Destructive Power: D / Speed: C / Range: D / Persistence: A / Precision: D / Development Potential: E

[The camera cuts back to Joseph slinging away from DIO.]

Joseph: It stops time!?

Joseph: It's a stand that can stop time and keep moving!?

Joseph: That's too dangerous! WAY too dangerous!!

[He slings away hastily, but DIO is catching up regardless.]

Joseph [his mind]: Calm down...calm down and think!

Joseph [his mind]: I don't know the meaning of the word ''panic''!

[He contradicted this statement of his many times before.]

[He looks back at DIO flying towards him.]

Joseph [his mind]: I need to think of him...

Joseph [his mind]: Some way to break through and defeat him!

[As he talks to himself, DIO suddenly warps away with a bass-boosted noise, to which he immediately lands and brakes in a rooftop.]

Joseph: H-He disappeared!

[Only for DIO to appear behind him and attempt to pierce Joseph's chest.]

[Joseph stares.]

[The World interrupts his punch, and Joseph confidently gets up and taunts his master.]

Joseph: W-What's wrong? Not going to hit me, DIO?

Joseph: Weren't you going to drink my blood?

[short beat]

DIO: You've suffused your body with Hamon to protect yourself.

[Joseph's confidence briefly breaks.]

DIO: Hamon and Hermit Purple are like a high-voltage wire wrapped around your body, isn't it?

DIO: You're quite the schemer, you cunning old man.

Joseph: The same goes for you.

[He pulls his shirt up, revealing his secret.]

Joseph: You realized i was using Hamon and made sure not to touch me.

Joseph: Very attentive of you.

Joseph: But i've figured something out about your stand.

[He shows his open hand.]

Joseph: DIO! Even though you can stop time, it looks like you can only do so very briefly.

Joseph: About 3 to 4 seconds, i'd say.

Joseph: If you could stop time for any longer, we would have all died back at your mansion, and you wouldn't have had to chase us down!

[DIO is unimpressed.]

DIO: So you understand how The World works? Hah!

DIO: I'll spare you a bit of praise for that.

[Joseph curls up his right hand into a fist, both angrily and with grief.]

Joseph: It was Kakyoin who figured it out.

Joseph: I won't let Kakyoin die for nothing!

DIO [confidently]: And what of it?

DIO [confidently]: What good does understanding my stand's power do for you?

[His eyes shrink.]

DIO [confidently]: What can your Hamon possibly do now!?

[Joseph powers up immediately, making a face similar to how he mourned Caesar Zeppeli's death 6 decades ago.]

Joseph: HERMIT PURPLE!!

Joseph: AND HAMON!!

[He attacks, but DIO retaliates intelligently...]

DIO: Enough! I don't need to touch the Hamon to attack you!!

[...by having his stand punch a nearby chimney that knocks Joseph out of the rooftop, along with its debris hitting him as well.]

[Joseph attempts to summon Hermit Purple to climb back up, but it's too late.]

[He falls down to the floor, and near a bunch of people who are having dinner outside of a restaurant.]

Customer 1: Hey, look!

Customer 2: That old guy fell out of the sky!

Female Customer 2: Santa! I bet he's Santa!

Customer 5: What were you doing on the roof?

[The camera briefly cuts to an Egyptian Mau cat eating a chicken wing.]

Customer 5: Checking out some hot chicks!?

[The customers share a laugh off-screen.]

[The camera shows Joseph getting up, and then looking back at the rooftop, watching DIO's slow descent.]

[He gets back on his feet and suddenly notices Jotaro arrive at the scene. Stardust Crusaders by Yugo Kanno briefly plays, but fades out shortly after.]

Jotaro: Grandpa...

Joseph: J-Jotaro!

[He panics and shows his hand.]

Joseph: Stay back!

[Jotaro immediately stops.]

Joseph: Don't come near me!

[The camera slowly reveals DIO hovering down.]

DIO: Jotaro...what perfect timing!

DIO: But he's not quite in range...

DIO: I'll deal with Joseph first.

[The cat jumps in horror after spotting DIO.]

Joseph: JOTARO! THE SECRET OF HIS STAND, THE WORLD, IS TIME!

[The camera gets closer and closer to Jotaro's shocked expression.]

Joseph: IT'S A STAND THAT STOPS TI-

DIO [interrupting Joseph]: THE WORLD!

[A bright flash briefly turns everything into negative colors, then into black and white, as time stops completely.]

[The camera shows Joseph, the customers, Jotaro, the customers again, and the cat. No sound is heard.]

[DIO lands.]

[??? by Yugo Kanno plays.]

DIO: At first, I could only stop time for a mere blink of an eye.

DIO: But as my neck wound began to heal, I soon could stop it for two seconds, then three.

[He tears the poor cat apart with a mere palm swat as he walks towards Joseph. ??? by Yugo Kanno plays.]

DIO: I can now stop time for five seconds.

DIO: It's strange to think of it as five seconds since it occurs when time is stopped, but I have 5 seconds in which to act.

[He swats one of the customers aside, as Dark Rebirth by Yugo Kanno plays.]

DIO: Eventually I'll get to a minute...then ten minutes, then an hour...

DIO: Then as long as I want!

[He stops next to Joseph.]

DIO: How pleasuring...

[He attempts to chop Joseph in half.]

DIO: Knowing that I will be able to stop time FOR LONGER AND LONGER!-

[...but then he stops, remembering Joseph's Hamon trap. ??? by Yugo Kanno plays.]

DIO: Oh, Joseph.

DIO: You were using Hamon to protect your body.

DIO: Hamon gave me a little trouble a hundred years ago, but it's powerless before The World.

[Remembering how he killed Jonathan by shooting high-pressure fluid from his eyes towards his neck, thus preventing him from breathing to activate his Hamon, he picks up a kitchen knife and looks at it closely.]

DIO: MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA!

DIO: MUDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!

[He throws the knife at Joseph's neck, but it freezes in place centimeters away from piercing it.]

[Katakana: Halt]

[The camera circles back to DIO. ??? by Yugo Kanno plays.]

DIO: Jonathan's grandson, Joseph!

DIO: You're dead.

[DIO turns to Jotaro and raises his finger]

DIO: One more second...

[The camera shows Jotaro's frozen expression and DIO's smirk.]

DIO [whispering]:...zero.

[Time resumes, and the knife impales Joseph's neck.]

Joseph: GBLWRGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!

[??? by Yugo Kanno briefly plays, and Manga Chapter 255 ends.]

[Stand Eyecatch:]

STAND NAME: The World

STAND MASTER: DIO

Destructive Power: A / Speed: A / Range: C / Persistence: A / Precision: B / Development Potential: B

[The camera cuts back to Joseph getting a knife impaled on his neck. He falls down, and the customers who were having a meal all panic.]

[One of the female customers has a lighter near her nose, the other has a fork stabbed in her cheek, and one of the male customers is having a seizure. Meanwhile, the other 3 gentlemen don't notice they're eating parts and drinking the blood of the Egyptian Mau DIO had murdered in stopped time.]

Joseph: GUBLRG....

[Joseph is bleeding out.]

Jotaro: GRAMPS!

[He tries to run to save Joseph, but the latter stops him once again.]

Joseph [weakly]: S-Stay back...!

Joseph [weakly]: Run...Jotaro...

Joseph [weakly]: don't go near him...

[Soul particles are seen. Jotaro is deeply shocked and frozen in place, unable to explain what happened.]

Joseph [weakly]: keep your....distance...

Joseph [weakly]:...stay away...

Joseph [weakly]:...stay away from him...

[His stand, Hermit Purple, is seen resonating one last time.]

Joseph [weakly]:...y...you're...no...

[Hermit Purple slowly dissipates into ash, as Joseph dies.]

[The camera cuts to a smiling DIO, as Awakening Darkness of the World by Yugo Kanno plays.]

[It then shows Jotaro up close, visibly enraged.]

Jotaro: . . . . . . . . . .

DIO: Kakyoin has been taken care of.

Jotaro:...!

[DIO looks around.]

DIO: Polnareff must be hiding somewhere...

DIO: Hah. But it doesn't matter.

[He menacingly points at Jotaro.]

DIO: And next, it's Jotaro...you.

[The camera zooms into Jotaro, and shows his left fist as curled up as it can possibly be.]

Jotaro: bastard...

[He walks forward.]

Jotaro: DIO!

DIO: Ho...Are you coming?

DIO: Are you approaching DIO without running away?

[The camera shows Joesph's corpse before cutting back to DIO taunting Jotaro.]

DIO: Even though Joseph told you the secret of The World, like an exam student scrambling to finish the problems on an exam until the last moments before the chime!?

Jotaro: If you don't get close, you won't be able to get ridiculous...

DIO: Hoho! Then come as close as you like...

[They both walk towards each other, silently.]

[Star Platinum suddenly appears to throw a punch at DIO.]

Star Platinum: ORA!

[But The World quickly responds by kicking Jotaro's leg instantaneously, leaving a hole in his pants.]

DIO: Sluggish, Sluggish! The World is the ultimate stand.

DIO: Even without his power to stop time, his speed and power far exceed that of your Star Platinum!

[Jotaro looks down at the hole the vampire's stand left in his pants.]

Jotaro: So it's the same kind of stand as Star Platinum.

Jotaro: Not much range, but immense power and precise movements.

DIO: I wanted to try a little test to find out just how much more powerful The World was, compared to your Stand.

DIO: Though it appears a test was hardly necessary.

Jotaro: A test?

Jotaro: Is that what you call just patting me, and not even enough to hurt?

Jotaro: Well, I guess you ripped my 20.000¥ pants though.

DIO: Why are you Joestars so stubborn about admitting defeat...?

DIO: Hah. I suppose I'll stand up to your little provocation and test you a bit more.

[The World appears.]

The World: HMMMHMMPH!

[He throws 4 punches that Star Platinum blocks, and it leaps away. Star Platinum performs rapid-fire kicks, hitting a speed limit sign as it does.]

[The World comes flying at Star Platinum, and the latter blocks the attack.]

Star Platinum: ORA!

[Star Platinum attempts to hit The World twice, missing twice.]

[However, DIO notices a small scar in his right cheek.]

[The two stands throw a flurry of punches at each other, revealing their incredible speed and precision.]

Star Platinum: ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA!!!

The World: HMMMHMMPH!

[The two halt temporarily, as their masters angrily stare at each other.]

DIO: Shall we compare the speed of our attack rushes?~

[DIO puts his hand on his injured cheek, quickly regenerating it shortly after.]

[The two stands throw a flurry of punches at each other again.]

The World: MUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA!!!!

Star Platinum: ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA!!!!

[The camera shows stills of DIO and Jotaro staring at each other, and then a still of The World and Star Platinum's punches connecting.]

[The ''To be continued'' arrow appears.]

[Manga Chapter 256 ends, and Episode 46 ends.]

[Last Train Home by The Pat Metheny Group plays as the second ending animation plays.]
[The World and Star Platinum continue exchanging punches at each other.]

The World: MUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA!!!!

Star Platinum: ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA!!!!

[The camera shows DIO smirking and Jotaro in a Tranquil Fury, staring at each other intensely.]

The World: MUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA!!!!

Star Platinum: ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA!!!!

[Due to the intense pressure of the wind their stands are creating, Jotaro and DIO begin to slowly hover up into the air.]

[The camera shows that happening while zooming at their shoes.]

[beat]

[Only the two stand's rushes could be heard for a few seconds. The camera shows them already floating up in the sky.]

DIO: Hm.

[The World's fists eventually subdue Star Platinum's.]

Star Platinum: Ngh!?

[The World punches Star Platinum's face, making it disappear.]

[A splash of blood comes out of Jotaro's mouth.]

DIO: The World is clearly much more powerful and precise!

DIO: You have shown me enough.

DIO: Prepare to meet your end!

Jotaro: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!

[As DIO monologues, flashbacks of the past are seen. Jonathan falling through the chimney, Jonathan having his neck pierced by his Space Ripper Stingy Eyes, and Jonathan's corpse hugging DIO's then severed head.]

DIO: The time has come for me to finally eradicate what little remains of the Joestar bloodline!

[Star Platinum immediately throws punches at DIO.]

Star Platinum: ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA-

DIO: I shall finish you here and now with the mighty power of The World!

[He extends his arms, and stops time in a bright flash.]

DIO: THE WORLD! TIME WILL STOP!

[The second series intro is cued. JoJo Sono Chi no Kioku ~end of THE WORLD~ by TOMMY, Coda, and JIN plays.]

[But then The World appears behind the screen Star Platinum was punching.]

DIO: The World!

[Time stops for 9 seconds as DIO walks behind Jotaro and poses.]

[The two stands exchange punches.]

Star Platinum: ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA!!

The World: MUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA...

Star Platinum: ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA...

[Then the intro ends normally.]

''Episode 47: DIO's World Part 3''

''DIOの世界 その3'

[The camera shows DIO and The World looking at Jotaro and Star Platinum frozen in place.]

DIO: With this, the Joestar bloodline will finally end.

DIO: My archnemesis, who dared to make an appearance in my destiny...

[He prepares to chop Jotaro in half.]

DIO: Farewell!

[He interrupts his finishing move after seeing Jotaro's fingers slightly twitch.]

[??? by Yugo Kanno plays.]

DIO: !?

[He distances himself after seeing it happen again.]

DIO: Ngh! What!?

DIO: He just moved!

DIO: This guy...Impossible!

DIO: His finger just moved!

DIO:...I-Impossible...

[He pieces something together by looking at Jotaro.]

DIO: Impossible...

[He then realized the horrifying truth.]

DIO: Impossible...the same!?

[Jotaro's fingers twitch again.]

[A short flashback that connects to DIO's fear begins.]

Jotaro: So it's the same kind of stand as Star Platinum.

[The flashback quickly ends.]

DIO: The World and Star Platinum are the same kind of Stand!?

[He is slightly irritated by this realization and he gets closer.]

DIO: This guy...can he see me?

DIO: Or is he moving his hand subconsciously?

DIO:...tch...

DIO: Time's up...

[He moves aside and avoids Star Platinum's punches.]

Star Platinum: ORAORA!!

[Katakana: Bam]

[Jotaro turns around, de-summoning his stand.]

DIO: Could you see me?

[??? by Yugo Kanno plays.]

[Jotaro turns a blind eye.]

DIO: I ASKED IF YOU COULD SEE ME, JOTARO!

Jotaro: Who knows?

Jotaro: I don't know what you're talking about, DIO.

[He flies away. DIO begins chasing him.]

[Star Platinum bumps a building to re-direct his master's flight direction.]

DIO: It's okay! It doesn't matter...

DIO: It doesn't matter if you can see me during the stopped time or not!

[The World bumps a building to redirect his master's flight direction.]

DIO: If you can move the same way as my The World, let me see you moving!

[He then contemplates the first time he got his stand ability.]

DIO [his mind]: It was six months ago when I first stopped time.

[??? by Yugo Kanno plays.]

[A flashback begins.]

[At his mansion, Nukesaku and Enya Geil agreed to test his then-new ability. Enya was a spectator, while Nukesaku is the one who will fire the boomstick. In the manga, only the hands of an unknown person are seen holding it.]

[The star birthmark from Jonathan's body can be clearly seen.]

DIO [his mind]: In order to test out my stand's power and speed, I had one of my servants fire a shotgun at me.

DIO [his mind]: As I went to catch the pellets...

[Nukesaku fires and The World appears, stopping all of the pellets in place.]

DIO [his mind]: For a moment, it looked like everything had stopped.

DIO [his mind]: That's when it all began...

DIO [his mind]: At first, I thought it was an illusion.

DIO [his mind]: Trained boxers and those who are in accidents feel each other as if it were several seconds or minutes...

DIO [his mind]: I thought it was something like that.

DIO [his mind]: But The World was able to step around the pellets that hung suspended in stopped time.

DIO [his mind]: And...I could grab the pellets!

DIO [his mind in the past]: It's not an illusion...

Enya: Dio! You will surely be able to control time!

Enya: You must believe with more conviction that you can move within stopped time!

Enya: It must be like breathing! Like being able to snap an HB pencil in half with your fingers!

Enya: You must believe it's a perfectly natural thing for you to do!

Enya: What's more important is to recognize it as such!

Enya: You are the emperor of this world!

Enya: It's only natural for you to control time!

[Enya laughs.]

[Gears are seen connecting to each other, and then The World appears, with his arms inside the gear holes.]

[Katakana: Clang]

DIO [his mind]: And then one day, I felt the wheels of time truly enmesh themselves with The World!

DIO [his mind]: It was like a beam of light piercing the darkness...it truly was a magnificent feeling!

DIO: I, DIO, have surpassed all forms of life and Stands!

DIO: And now, I can stop time for five seconds, and longer and longer intervals each time!

[DIO is now more enthusiastic than ever to finish Jotaro off.]

DIO: Jotaro! I shall see just how powerful you truly are!

[He and The World's arms extend, stopping time in a bright flash. The camera shows the chase slowing down to a halt.]

DIO: THE WORLD! STOP TIME!!

[beat]

[The camera shows Jotaro up close, and then DIO hovering towards him. The music completely stops.]

[DIO notices Jotaro's right hand twitching. It was more than the last time.]

DIO: . . .

[DIO sighs and looks at his arm.]

[Jotaro's hand twitches again.]

[He laughs, progressively harder each time.]

[Final Battle by Yugo Kanno plays.]

[He notices a round magnet in his hand.]

[He takes it off and places it in one of Jotaro's shirt pins. They get attracted to each other regardless of the time not flowing.]

DIO: You had placed that magnet on me...when we were testing each other's strength earlier?

DIO: It looks like a magnet taken from a wallet or pocket planner.

DIO: Hah. You completely fooled me.

DIO: I can't take my eyes off you for a second.

[He hovers up.]

DIO: However!

DIO: If you're using a trick like this, that proves you can't move during stopped time!

[The World appears and flies towards Jotaro, opening his mouth.]

DIO: You only added a few more seconds to your life!

DIO: THIS TIME YOU'RE DEAD, JOTARO!!

[Katakana: Zwoosh]

[But then Jotaro moved and summoned his stand to pierce The World's chest ]

[Katakana: Bagoom]

[A hole bursts out of DIO's chest.]

DIO: WHAT!?

[Star Platinum and Jotaro then freeze in place.]

[Manga Chapter 257 ends.]

DIO: H-He...really can move!

DIO: Only for a moment, but he can move!

DIO: The magnet wasn't to trick me into thinking he could move...

DIO: But to trick me into thinking he couldn't, and lure me closer!

[He remembers Enya's words.]

Enya: It's only natural for you to control time!

[The camera zooms into DIO's shocked expression.]

DIO [his mind]: Of all things, this descendant of the Joestars has invaded my world of stopped time...

[Time resumes, and Star Platinum launches DIO into a jewelry shop, shattering the window. One of the window shards cuts DIO's leg off.]

Jotaro: !

Jewelry Shop Owner: AHH!?

Jewelry Shop Owner: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!!!!

[Jotaro clings onto the shop's sign.]

Jotaro: I could move for a moment...just a moment!

Jotaro: But....good grief.

Jotaro: It was only enough to get one punch in.

[Meanwhile, at the shop...]

[DIO gets up, to the horror of the Jewelry Shop attendee.]

[Dark Rebirth by Yugo Kanno plays.]

DIO: You, woman.

[The shop owner panics.]

DIO: Fetch me my leg from over there.

[She is too scared to do anything.]

DIO: HURRY UP AND FETCH IT!

DIO: Behave like a flight attendant, bringing a drink and caviar to a first-class passenger!

[Jotaro lands in front of the shop and spots DIO draining the blood of the poor woman to the sound of her heartbeat.]

[The camera shows his leg regenerating.]

Jotaro: I guess I have to bash your head to pieces, or it'll be like nothing happened.

Jotaro: You've already recovered your energy.

[DIO is shown with his hand still stabbing the now-deceased woman's neck.]

Jotaro: Because that hole I put up in your gut is closed now.

[DIO drops her and disappears.]

[Jotaro is now looking at DIO, who is standing on top of a speed limit sign.]

DIO: Your eyes followed me in the world of stopped time...

DIO: So you can see my movements, Jotaro!

Jotaro: Seems so.

DIO: Kakyoin did quite well for you.

DIO: Because he figured out the secret of The World's powers, you were able to figure out that you could move in stopped time, and so, you were able to invade my world!

[He vanishes again.]

Jotaro: !

DIO: Which makes me think...

[The camera shows him on top of a building.]

DIO: Just how long can you move within my world of stopped time? Two seconds? Three seconds? Or perhaps you can move for five seconds just like me, and you're just pretending that you can't? And so on.

[DIO laughs it off.]

DIO: Well? How about it?

Jotaro [his mind]: This isn't good...

Jotaro [his mind]: I could move longer with some practice, but right now a moment is the best I can do.

[Jotaro curls up his fist.]

DIO: I believe you can only move for a moment now...but since you have invaded my world of stopped time, it wouldn't be wise to underestimate you by getting close.

DIO: Even when I still have an overwhelming advantage!

Jotaro: !

DIO: So, therefore, Jotaro...I've decided how to kill you such that it doesn't matter how long you can move!

[DIO is shown with 10 knives on his belt, but then he reveals 11 more knives, 5 in his right hand, and 6 on his left hand.]

Jotaro: Ngh!?

DIO: You've gone pale.

DIO: When you saw these knives, you realize that you face a more horrific fate than that gold geezer Joseph!

Jotaro [his mind]: Bastard...how the hell does he come up with stuff like this!?

Jotaro [his mind]: This guy's dangerous!

[He flees.]

DIO: Ha! You cannot escape!

[He summons his stand.]

DIO: THE WORLD!

[The World quickly stops time in a bright flash.]

[DIO leaps towards Jotaro and summons his stand to grab the knives on his hands.]

DIO [to his stand]: Five seconds!

[The World throws the knives at Jotaro, as they freeze centimeters away from stabbing him. ??? by Yugo Kanno plays.]'

DIO: Once time begins to move again, I wonder if even your Star Platinum can manage to deflect so many knives!

[Jotaro is surrounded by exactly more than 60 knives.]

DIO [to his stand]: Four more seconds!

[The World throws 6 more knives at Jotaro.]

[DIO laughs in joy.]

DIO: Being able to see this must be all the more terrifying, Jotaro!

DIO: Three more seconds!

[He throws 3 knives at Jotaro, but Star Platinum suddenly appears.]

Star Platinum: ORA!!

[It deflects his 3 knives and 12 more before freezing in place once again. ??? by Yugo Kanno plays.]

DIO: Just two more seconds...is that all you can do?

[DIO laughs.]

DIO: This proves you really can move only for a moment.

[He floats away and sits in a chimney.]

DIO: One more second...

[The camera shows Jotaro staring at DIO.]

DIO: Zero.

[The knives resume their course and fly towards a shocked Jotaro.]

[Star Platinum instantaneously appears and deflects the knives.]

Star Platinum: ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA!!

[Even though it succeeds, 7 knives reach Jotaro and stab him in the chest, arms, and left knee.]

Jotaro: Nh...kugh!?

[Jotaro falls down, injured.]

DIO: It's over.

DIO: I'll add one more, just to be sure.

[The World throws the remaining knife at Jotaro, but Star Platinum appears and attempts to deflect it, only for the knife to land straight in his head.]

Jotaro: NGH!!

DIO: To be frank, I'm relieved that I could defeat you so quickly, Jotaro.

[The World disappears.]

[DIO pulls down his shirt and looks at his Joestar birthmark.]

DIO: It's unbelievable to think you would be able to enter my stopped time.

DIO: As I see it, those machines known as vehicles are useful devices, but because everyone has one, the streets become too crowded.

[Jotaro lands in the sidewalk between a crowd.]

[Manga Chapter 258 ends from there.]

DIO: Only I, DIO, should have power over stopped time.

[The crowd flees and the music stops.]

Jotaro:...nhh...

Jotaro: Good grief...

Jotaro: Throwing all those knives...now my valuable uniform is full of holes.

[He checks the magazines he hid under his chest and hat.]

Jotaro [his mind]: I stuffed my clothes with magazines just in case he tried throwing anything...but I didn't think he'd throw that many knives at me.

Jotaro [his mind]: Playing dead and waiting for a chance to strike is the best chance I have right now.

[The camera cuts to Jotaro's POV.]

Jotaro [his mind]: I need to figure out how to knock off his head....otherwise, he won't die.

[He spots him flying towards a sharp left turn sign.]

[??? by Yugo Kanno plays.]

Jotaro: Ch...!

DIO: I'd better play it safe....the Joestar bloodline has proved itself rather lucky.

DIO: He might be trying to trick me by playing dead.

[DIO's guess puts more pressure on Jotaro.]

DIO: I must end him beyond a shadow of a doubt!

[Jotaro is visibly scared by the vampire's words.]

DIO: By...chopping his head off with this!

[He kicks a sign and picks it up like a hammer.]

[Jotaro is seen literally sweating by DIO's plan.]

DIO: This is the end....JOTARO!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[DIO leaps into the air, ready for the killing blow.]

[??? by Yugo Kanno suddenly plays.]

[Polnareff is seen leaping behind DIO. Jotaro can only watch his next move.]

[Polnareff summons his stand and flies towards DIO, aiming Silver Chariot's rapier to his head.]

[DIO notices too late, as the rapier pierces his brain's left hemisphere.]

Polnareff: GO TO HELL, DIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!

[Pause for a commercial break.]

[Stand Eyecatch:]

STAND NAME: The World

STAND MASTER: DIO

Destructive Power: A / Speed: A / Range: C / Persistence: A / Precision: B / Development Potential: B

[The camera shows Polnareff using Silver Chario's rapier to pierce through DIO's head.]

Polnareff: GO TO HELL!

Jotaro [his mind]: POLNAREFF!!

[The World is summoned off-screen...]

[...and time stops in a bright flash.]

[Everything is grayscaled except for Jotaro and DIO.]

DIO: The World...Time will stop.

[Polnareff is seen behind DIO with a shocked/angry face. DIO withdraws his head from the rapier and looks behind him.]

DIO: I thought so, Polnareff...

[He punches him in the side and ducks down. The punching sound is reversed in the middle.]

DIO: Time moves on.

[Time unfreezes, and Polnareff is sent flying.]

Polnareff: BLAGH!-

[He lands into a building gate. ??? by Yugo Kanno plays.]

Polnareff: Ngh!!

DIO: Too bad, Polnareff!

DIO: With just a moment more, and with just a tiny bit more force, you could have torn my brain apart with your rapier!

[His injury regenerates]

Polnareff: b-bastard...this is impossible...

[He passes out. DIO picks up the sign again.]

DIO: I, DIO, can't be assassinated!

DIO: Joestar's Egyptian tour group...will be no more, once I finish you...

Jotaro [his mind]: I can't believe it...Polnareff's going to get killed.

Jotaro [his mind]: I wanted to play dead as long as possible until I could land a blow to his head, but...it would be easy for me to keep Polnareff's head on his shoulders.

Jotaro [his mind]: But DIO won't enter Star Platinum's attack range. It'll end up like last time.

[Flashbacks of DIO's knife throws at Jotaro are shown.]

Jotaro [his mind]: I have to make sure he doesn't realize I'm alive.

Jotaro [his mind]: As long as he doesn't know for sure, my chances to get close to him will come.

[DIO is seen walking towards Polnareff with the sign, ready to decapitate him.]

Jotaro [his mind]: Talk about irony...I tried my hardest to move inside his stopped time, but now I have to try my hardest to stay completely still.

DIO: Goodbye, Polnareff!

[He swings, but stops after hearing Jotaro's right hand twitch.]

[He somersaults towards Jotaro's ''corpse''. Dark Rebirth by Yugo Kanno plays.]

DIO: Jotaro, you...

[He listens closely.]

DIO: You're alive...or you're coming around...

DIO: hmmm...

[He then hears a gun reload, and spots two cops approach him from behind.]

Police Officer 1: Don't move! We're the police!

Police Officer 2: We have guns pointed at you!

Police Officer 2: Put your hands up slowly...

[The officers were clearly scared.]

[DIO doesn't seem to care. But he suddenly stops time and appears behind them.]

[He mortally swats one of them off, launching him away. He puts his claws on the remaining police officer's neck.]

DIO: All right, perfect timing!

DIO: There's something I'd like for you to shoot with that gun.

[He moves the scared cop closer to Jotaro.]

DIO: Shoot the man lying down on the ground over there.

[He forcibly makes him aim his pistol to Jotaro's ''body''. The officer's heartbeat is heard.]

DIO: You can shoot his leg, his torso...whatever you like.

[The officer can't properly aim now.]

DIO: Come on...be sure not to miss.

[The officer fires at Jotaro, seemingly hitting his side.]

[DIO finishes draining the blood of the officer, and drops him.]

DIO: Perhaps I was just imagining that sound i thought i heard coming from Jotaro.

[The camera takes a closer look. It reveals Star Platinum caught the bullet, just like how it did back in Episode 1 when Jotaro shot himself to reveal his then-unnamed ''evil spirit''.]

Jotaro [his mind]: What a sick thing to do...but now DIO's attention is on me, not Polnareff!

Jotaro [his mind]: Right now, he's suspicious as all hell...

[DIO is seen listening closely.]

Jotaro [his mind]: He'll try to make absolutely sure that I'm dead.

Jotaro [his mind]: This is when things get really dangerous.

DIO: The sound of his breathing...

[He listens closely.]

DIO: I don't hear it. He's not breathing.

[He walks up to Jotaro and crouches.]

DIO: Then what about his heartbeat?

[Jotaro panics and quietly summons Star Platinum to stop his heart for as long as DIO wants to hear it.]

[His eyes begin to wither and go cataract.]

[DIO is shown placing his ear on the asphalt.]

Jotaro [his mind]: This is fucking tough...if I black out, I will die.

Jotaro [his mind]: If i die because i used my Stand to stop my own heart...

[Jotaro's eyes go completely cataract. DIO is shown listening again for a bit more.]

DIO: His heart isn't beating. He is definitely dead.

[DIO gets up to grab the sign he used twice to nearly decapitate Jotaro and Polnareff.]

DIO: I thought he was still alive, but it was just my imagination.

DIO: Just in case, I'll lop off his head so that i can truly rest at ease.

DIO: All right, Jotaro?

[Star Platinum lets go of his master's heart.]

[DIO prepares to decapitate Jotaro.]

DIO: Hmm!!

Jotaro: !!

[The vampire swings, but quickly finds his sign bent in half to his utter shock. Most of the knives are seen coming off from Jotaro's body due to the sheer force of Star Platinum's punch.]

[Katakana: Rumble]

[Decisive Battle by Yugo Kanno plays.]

DIO: WHAT!?

DIO: !!

[He looks up to see Star Platinum in front of him, furiously staring at the vampire as it clenches its right fist hard.]

Star Platinum: ORAAAAA!!

DIO: TIME WILL STOP!

[DIO attempts to stop time in a bright flash.]

DIO: THE WORLD!-

[Star Platinum lands a fierce punch into DIO's left hemisphere.]

DIO: GAH!

[Jotaro sits up.]

Jotaro: I went through hell there...but even if you stop time, I'm STILL going to blow your fucking head off, DIO!

[Star Platinum's fist smashes through DIO's skull with the intent of killing him, and not just incapacitating him anymore. A heart is seen in his skull's forehead.]

DIO: WH...WHAT THE HELL...IMPOSSIBLE...

Star Platinum: OOOOOOOORAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!

[Star Platinum launches DIO to a step street.]

DIO: GWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!

[DIO crashes into the step street, producing a lot of rubble and dust. Jotaro in the meantime weakly gets up, exhausted from playing dead to the extreme.]

Jotaro: I did it...

Jotaro: I was able to bash his head in...

[Katakana: Menacing]

Jotaro: But that bastard DIO is a monster who survived a hundred years at the bottom of the ocean...

Jotaro: I can't believe he is dead yet...it's too soon to relax.

[The camera briefly shows some buckets before cutting to DIO, who weakly gets up.]

DIO [weakly]:...uuuuuuuuughhhhhhhmh...

DIO [weakly]: i'll...kill...youuuuuu...

[He falls down, apparently incapacitated by Star Platinum's punch.]

DIO [weakly]: W-What is this...!? Impossible, I can't move my legs!...

DIO [weakly]: i can't move my legs...I can't stand!

[DIO falls over. Meanwhile, Jotaro has picked some buckets shown seconds before. Star Platinum punches a car's fuel tank open, letting it flow.]

DIO [weakly]: I have a headache...and nausea!

DIO [weakly]: Oh my god...I, DIO...feeling sick...!?

DIO [weakly]: my head's been destroyed...so I can't get up...?

[Jotaro is seen walking to the vampire with the bucket full of gasoline.]

DIO [his mind]: I can't believe it...I have to do something!

DIO: BGH!?

[Jotaro has thrown the gasoline on the weakened vampire.]

DIO: ghh...

Jotaro: I covered you with gasoline so I can track your smell.

Jotaro: I feel bad kicking a guy when he's down, but...nah. I don't feel bad about this at all.

[He throws the bucket away and turns on a lighter to lit DIO ablaze.]

Jotaro: My friends and a lot of innocent bystanders are dead because of you.

DIO: gh...

[DIO laughs it off...then laughs progressively harder.]

[A car is briefly seen passing by the street nearby. Jotaro is appropriately shocked by the vampire's laughter.]

DIO: ghhh...[more grunting]

DIO: The World!...

[He stops time in a bright flash before Jotaro could throw the lighter at him.]

DIO [weakly]: If i can...if i can get to that place...

[DIO weakly crawls to the antique taxi cab's rear bumper, wanting to head towards a certain someone's corpse.]

DIO [weakly]: Time....time moves on...!

[Time resumes, and the taxi cab resumes its course.]

[Stardust Crusaders by Yugo Kanno plays.]

[Jotaro walks up the step street.]

Jotaro: He put his ear to the ground to listen to someone coming near...

[He pulls out a knife stabbed in his shoulder and throws it at the Taxi with Star Platinum's assistance.]

Jotaro: However...I can't let him get away!

[The main part of Jotaro's theme plays as the knife flies and bursts one of the taxi cab's tires, sending it crashing towards a building.]

[Katakana: Screech]

DIO: NGH!

[DIO rolls down in the pavement towards a sewer door, to which he grabs it quickly.]

DIO: DOGH!!

DIO: GH!!

DIO [weakly]: MMMGHHHHHHH.....that place...that place!...

[He drags the sewer door open.]

DIO [weakly]: If i can just get there...

DIO: Gh!?

[Jotaro is shown inside the sewer pointing at DIO, apparently having stopped time himself to do that.]

Jotaro: This place is taken...you can't escape.

[DIO weakly gasps as Jotaro levitates at him.]

Jotaro: Give up...

Jotaro: DIO.

[beat]

[His theme's buildup can be heard. Jotaro and DIO are seen staring at each other tensely.]

[Jotaro's fingers move slightly, and DIO quickly gets up, attempting to stop time and to throw a knife at Jotaro.]

DIO: THE WORLD! TI-

Star Platinum: ORAAAAAAAAA!!!

[But Star Platinum throws a punch at his brain's left hemisphere again, and violently pummels him, more viciously than how he did to DIO's minions.]

Star Platinum: ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA!!!

Star Platinum: OOOOOOOOORAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!

[He destroys DIO's skull with one final punch, sending him flying across Cairo, bleeding like a fountain, and with multiple holes on his body.]

DIO: GWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!

[Star Platinum does a punching pose, and Jotaro silently watches the vampire fly away.]

DIO: BGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!!

[Awakening Darkness of The World by Yugo Kanno plays.]

DIO: I WIN, JOTARO!

DIO: THIS IS MY ESCAPE PLAN!

[Despite him having gigantic holes on his body, his skull completely crushed and bleeding like a fountain, he performs his century-old Rocket Strategy and yells like crazy, taunting Jotaro.]

DIO: YOU HAVE LOST THE BATTLE OF WITS AGAINST ME, DIO!!

DIO [voice cracking]: DOESN'T THIS STrEeT lOoK fAmIiAr!?!?

Jotaro: !

[DIO lands in an explosion of rubble and dust....to where Joseph's corpse is!]

[Jotaro looks around]

[And realized what DIO said was true...]

Jotaro: This street....impossible...!

[Joseph's heartbeat is heard. The dust eventually reveals DIO draining his corpse's blood.]

DIO [normally]: That's right.

DIO: It was my escape route to take the blood Joseph Joestar!

[He removes his clawed fingernails off Joseph's neck, revealing his new musculature and lack of coat.]

[He stares at Jotaro with a smirk.]

Jotaro: YOU...

Jotaro: DIO!!

[The ''To be continued'' arrow appears.]

[Manga Chapter 261 ends, and Episode 47, Stardust Crusaders' penultimate episode, ends.]

[Last Train Home by The Pat Metheny Group plays as the second ending animation plays.]
